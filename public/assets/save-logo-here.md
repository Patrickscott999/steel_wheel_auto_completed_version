# Adding the Steel Wheel Auto Logo

1. Save the Steel Wheel Auto logo image (the one you shared) to this directory with the filename:
   ```
   steel-wheel-logo.png
   ```

2. The PDF generator is already configured to look for this file and will automatically add it to the top-right corner of your invoices.

Note: If you need to adjust the size or position of the logo, you can modify the settings in the `/services/pdf.js` file.
