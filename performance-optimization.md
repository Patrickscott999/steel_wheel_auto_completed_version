# Performance Optimization Plan

## Frontend Optimizations

### Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
```javascript
// In app/page.tsx, implement lazy loading for components that aren't immediately visible
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

// Lazy load the invoice preview component
const InvoicePreview = dynamic(() => import('@/components/invoice-preview'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading preview...</p>,
  ssr: false // Disable server-side rendering for components with browser-specific dependencies
});

// Lazy load the login modal since it's conditionally displayed
const LoginModal = dynamic(() => import('@/components/login-modal'), {
  ssr: true // This can be server-rendered for faster initial load
});
```

### Image Optimization
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
- Implement proper image sizes and formats (WebP support)
- Apply responsive image techniques

### Bundle Size Reduction
- Run `npm run build && npm run analyze` to identify large dependencies
- Consider replacing heavy libraries with lighter alternatives
- Remove unused dependencies and code

## Backend Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Cache PDF templates to reduce generation time
- Use Firebase caching for repeated queries

### API Optimization
- Compress API responses with gzip/brotli
- Implement pagination for invoice listing endpoints
- Add proper indexing to Firestore collections

### Performance Monitoring
- Set up performance monitoring with tools like Datadog or New Relic
- Track API response times and optimize slow endpoints
- Monitor PDF generation performance

## Browser Compatibility Testing

### Desktop Browsers
- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest version)

### Mobile Browsers
- Chrome for Android
- Safari for iOS
- Samsung Internet

### Test Focus Areas
- Login functionality
- Form submission
- Invoice preview rendering
- Email delivery
- PDF appearance

## Implementation Schedule

1. **Immediate Improvements**
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading
   - Optimize images
   - Add caching headers

2. **Secondary Optimizations**
   - Reduce bundle size
   - Optimize API endpoints
   - Add performance monitoring

3. **Final Polish**
   - Fine-tune animation performance
   - Optimize for lower-end devices
   - Address browser-specific issues

## Expected Outcomes

- 30-40% reduction in initial load time
- 50% faster invoice generation
- Smooth experience across all major browsers and devices
- Better performance on mobile devices with limited bandwidth
